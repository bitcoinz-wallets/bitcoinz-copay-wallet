## Testing in a Browser

> **Note:** This method should only be used for development purposes. When running BTCZ Wallet in a normal browser environment, browser extensions and other malicious code might have access to internal data and private keys. For production use, see the latest official [releases](https://github.com/bitcoinz-wallets/bitcoinz-copay-wallet/tags).

Clone the repo and open the directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/bitcoinz-wallets/bitcoinz-copay-wallet.git
cd btcz-wallet
```

Install npm modules
```
npm install
```

Ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then install and start BTCZ Wallet:

```
npm start
```

Visit [`localhost:8100`](http://localhost:8100/) to view the app.

A watch task is also available to rebuild components of the app as changes are made. This task can be run in a separate process – while the server started by `npm start` is running – to quickly test changes.

```
npm run watch
```

## Testing on Real Devices

It's recommended that all final testing be done on a real device – both to assess performance and to enable features that are unavailable to the emulator (e.g. a device camera).

## Build BTCZ Wallet App Bundles

Before building the release version for a platform, run the `clean-all` command to delete any untracked files in your current working directory. (Be sure to stash any uncommitted changes you've made.) This guarantees consistency across builds for the current state of this repository.

The `final` commands build the production version of the app, and bundle it with the release version of the platform being built.

### Android

```
npm run clean-all
npm install
npm run final:android
```

### iOS

```
npm run clean-all
npm install
npm run final:ios
```

## About BTCZ

### General

BTCZ implements a multisig wallet using [p2sh](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash) addresses.  It supports multiple wallets, each with its own configuration, such as 3-of-5 (3 required signatures from 5 participant peers) or 2-of-3.  To create a multisig wallet shared between multiple participants, BTCZ requires the extended public keys of all the wallet participants.  Those public keys are then incorporated into the wallet configuration and combined to generate a payment address where funds can be sent into the wallet.  Conversely, each participant manages their own private key and that private key is never transmitted anywhere.

To unlock a payment and spend the wallet's funds, a quorum of participant signatures must be collected and assembled in the transaction.  The funds cannot be spent without at least the minimum number of signatures required by the wallet configuration (2-of-3, 3-of-5, 6-of-6, etc.).  Once a transaction proposal is created, the proposal is distributed among the wallet participants for each to sign the transaction locally.  Finally, when the transaction is signed, the last signing participant will broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network.

BTCZ also implements [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) to generate new addresses for peers.  The public key that each participant contributes to the wallet is a BIP32 extended public key.  As additional public keys are needed for wallet operations (to produce new addresses to receive payments into the wallet, for example) new public keys can be derived from the participants' original extended public keys.  Once again, it's important to stress that each participant keeps their own private keys locally - private keys are not shared - and are used to sign transaction proposals to make payments from the shared wallet.

For more information regarding how addresses are generated using this procedure, see: [Structure for Deterministic P2SH Multisignature Wallets](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki).

## BTCZ Backups and Recovery

Since v1.2 BTCZ uses BIP39 mnemonics for backing up wallets.  The BIP44 standard is used for wallet address derivation. Multisig wallets use P2SH addresses, while non-multisig wallets use P2PKH.

Information about backup and recovery procedures is available at: https://github.com/bitcoinz-wallets/bitcoinz-copay-wallet/blob/master/backupRecovery.md

Previous versions of BTCZ used files as backups. See the following section.

It is possible to recover funds from a BTCZ Wallet without using BTCZ Wallet or the Wallet Service, check the [Copay Recovery Tool](https://github.com/bitpay/copay-recovery).


## Wallet Export Format

BTCZ Wallet encrypts the backup with the [Stanford JS Crypto Library](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/).  To extract the private key of your wallet you can use https://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/demo/, copy the backup to 'ciphertext' and enter your password.  The resulting JSON will have a key named: `xPrivKey`, that is the extended private key of your wallet.  That information is enough to sign any transaction from your wallet, so be careful when handling it!

The backup also contains the key `publicKeyRing` that holds the extended public keys of the Copayers.
Depending on the key `derivationStrategy`, addresses are derived using
[BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) or [BIP45](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki). Wallets created in BTCZ Wallet v1.2 and forward always use BIP44, all previous wallets use BIP45. Also note that since BTCZ Wallet version v1.2, non-multisig wallets use address types Pay-to-PublicKeyHash (P2PKH) while multisig wallets still use Pay-to-ScriptHash (P2SH) (key `addressType` at the backup):

| BTCZ Wallet Version  | Wallet Type   | Derivation Strategy   | Address Type  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  <1.2  | All  |  BIP45 | P2SH   |
|  >=1.2 | Non-multisig  | BIP44  | P2PKH   |
| >=1.2  | Multisig  |  BIP44 |  P2SH   |
| >=1.5  | Multisig Hardware wallets  |  BIP44 (root m/48') |  P2SH   |

Using a tool like [Bitcore PlayGround](http://bitcore.io/playground) all wallet addresses can be generated. (TIP: Use the `Address` section for P2PKH address type wallets and `Multisig Address` for P2SH address type wallets). For multisig addresses, the required number of signatures (key `m` on the export) is also needed to recreate the addresses.

BIP45 note: All addresses generated at BWS with BIP45 use the 'shared cosigner index' (2147483647) so BTCZ Wallet address indexes look like: `m/45'/2147483647/0/x` for main addresses and `m/45'/2147483647/1/y` for change addresses.

Since version 1.5, BTCZ Wallet uses the root `m/48'` for hardware multisignature wallets. This was coordinated with Ledger and Trezor teams. While the derivation path format is still similar to BIP44, the root was in order to indicate that these wallets are not discoverable by scanning addresses for funds. Address generation for multisignature wallets requires the others extended public keys.


## Bitcore Wallet Service

BTCZ Wallet depends on [Bitcore Wallet Service](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service) (BWS) for blockchain information, networking and BTCZ Wallet synchronization.  A BWS instance can be setup and operational within minutes or you can use a public instance like `https://bws.bitpay.com`.  Switching between BWS instances is very simple and can be done with a click from within BTCZ Wallet.  BWS also allows BTCZ Wallet to interoperate with other wallets like [Bitcore Wallet CLI] (https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet).

## Hardware Wallet Support

BTCZ Wallet supports Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets. Hardware wallet support is only available through the Chrome App. Ledger support is only available on multisig wallets.

To use Ledger, you need to have the Ledger Chrome App installed, available at:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ledger-wallet/kkdpmhnladdopljabkgpacgpliggeeaf

To use Trezor, you need to have the Trezor Chrome Extension installed, available at:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trezor-chrome-extension/jcjjhjgimijdkoamemaghajlhegmoclj

To create or join a wallet using Ledger or Trezor go to:

  Add Wallet -> Create or Join -> Advanced options -> Wallet Seed -> select Trezor or Ledger

Both devices support multiple accounts, so you can use them for multiple wallets. Select the account and then click on create or join.

It is also possible to import a wallet from a device using:
  Add Wallet -> Import -> Hardware wallet

Here it is also necesary to select the account number.

When creating or joining a wallet, BTCZ Wallet will ask for two public keys for the device. One public keys is used for the wallet itself and the other is used as an entropy source to create a private / public key pair for signing requests to the Wallet Service.

Every time you need to sign a transaction, the device will be needed to perform the signature. Follow the on screen instructions after clicking the `send` or `accept` buttons.

Finally, in case you lose the device and you have the 24 word seed for the device, you can recover access to your funds using BTCZ Wallet, see: https://github.com/bitcoinz-wallets/bitcoinz-copay-wallet/blob/master/backupRecovery.md#hardware-wallets

## Release Schedules
BTCZ Wallet uses the `MAJOR.MINOR.BATCH` convention for versioning.  Any release that adds features should modify the MINOR or MAJOR number.

### Bug Fixing Releases

We release bug fixes as soon as possible for all platforms.  Usually around a week after patches, a new release is made with language translation updates (like 1.1.4 and then 1.1.5).  There is no coordination so all platforms are updated at the same time.

### Minor and Major Releases
- t+0: tag the release 1.2 and "text lock" (meaning only non-text related bug fixes. Though this rule is sometimes broken, it's good to make a rule.)
- t+7: testing for 1.2 is finished, translation is also finished, and 1.2.1 is tagged with all translations along with bug fixes made in the last week.
- t+7: iOS is submitted for 1.2.1. All other platforms are submitted with auto-release off.
- t + (~17): All platforms 1.2.1 are released when Apple approves the iOS application update.
